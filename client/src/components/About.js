                MyStudyNotes is  is a personal project I created during the time of self-study to put into practice what I was learning at the FreeCodeCamp and various other platforms for learning programming.
                Even though, MyStudyNotes was created for practice it also aims to simplify a personal daily task when self-learning.
                MyStudyNotes, therefore allows users to organize their learning material into libraries
                and create notes to save the knowledge and materials accumulated during their self-study.
                It also allows change the relevance of the material written in the note by alternating its status to 'mastered'.
