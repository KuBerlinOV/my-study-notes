# my-study-notes

-Background

MyStudyNotes is  is a personal project I created during the time of self-study to put into practice what I was learning at the FreeCodeCamp and 
various other platforms for learning programming.
Even though, MyStudyNotes was created for practice it also aims to simplify a personal daily task when self-learning.
MyStudyNotes, therefore allows users to organize their learning material into libraries
and create notes to save the knowledge and materials accumulated during their self-study.
